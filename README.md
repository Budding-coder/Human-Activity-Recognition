# Human-Activity-Recognition

Description:

These days Smartphones have become an integral part of our life where we cannot assume our life without a mobile phone. Smartphones have very
interesting sensors in addition to cameras. These sensors are very useful when playing games and enhances the user experience.
Two such sensors are called Accelerometer and Gyroscope. Accelerometer measures acceleration and Gyroscope measures angular velocity.
 
Here we are tying to collect the data from Accelerometer and Gyroscope and use this data to predict the activity that the person is 
performing. 


Problem Statement :

Problem statement is, we are trying to determine what is the activity that the human is performing using sensors that we have in smart
phones. 
This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.
We are building a 6-class classifier.

Why is this useful :

These daya many people are using smart watches like Fitbit or Apple watch etc., to track sleep and activity levels of the day. These
watches internally contains an Accelerometer and Gyroscope. These records the human activity data and we use this data to determine
if we are actually running , walking , Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs etc,. Using all this data, Accelerometer and Gyroscope predicts
how many calories are burnt or hours of sleep , heartbeats using heart-rate sensors. 

So by using these sensors, we are trying to predict human activities. We can use these activities and map them to one of the measures , 
like how many calories are burnt, how many hours of sleep etc .
Hence, a person who has Smartphone can monitor his/her health using these sensors and predictions.
